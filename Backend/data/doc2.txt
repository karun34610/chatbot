### ******************************************************************Process to change the citizenship on PAN Card******************************************************************

No direct provisions exist to change citizenship in a Pan Card as the **PAN Card** doesn’t display your citizenship. It is a document required to file taxes, carry out investments and do transactions in India, whether you are a citizen, NRI, or OCI.

To change the citizenship in a PAN card, you must meet and notify your jurisdictional Assessing Officer. For NRIs, it is not easy to meet the assessing officer. However, ABC can meet or notify the jurisdictional assessing officer on your behalf. Contact a tax expert at ABC to change your citizenship on PAN card.

**Time required to update the citizenship status:** Generally, it takes around a month to complete the process, but the duration can vary based on factors such as workload and the authorities' responsiveness.
